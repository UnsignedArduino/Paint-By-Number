# Paint-By-Number

An online, no-account website that allows you to digitally paint by numbers!

## Install

1. Install Gatsby stuff:

   - Node.js (v14.15 or newer)
   - Git
   - And obviously Gatsby CLI itself (v4 or newer)

   Check the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/#installation-guide) for better steps on installing Gatsby.

2. Clone this repo.
3. `npm install` for dependencies.
4. `npm run prepare` for ESLint precommit hook.

## Develop

Use `gatsby develop` to start a development server. Note that hot-module reloading does not work on the `/paint` page, manually reload the page after saving in your editor.

Before commit, make sure to format, (`npm run format`) lint, (`npm run lint`) and type-check. (`npm run typecheck`)

## Build and serve

`gatsby build` and `gatsby serve`.

This site is currently hosted on Gatsby Cloud at [https://paintbynumbermain.gatsbyjs.io/](https://paintbynumbermain.gatsbyjs.io/).
